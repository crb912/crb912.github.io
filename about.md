Never too old to learn.

Use my limited lifespan to enhance my productivity and pursue the development of my personal wisdom and rationality.

I love learning because it makes me smarter.

Strive to give my absolute best to become the best version of myself. Focus on myself—just as Nietzsche said, don't become a fly swatter.

When I reached my thirties, I began to realise that, for an individual, the most important thing in life is to find something to do—to fall in love with certain things, for only then does one truly feel alive. One should try not to let oneself become idle; the moment one does, it’s all too easy to slip into nihilism or depression. Keep stirring things up—keep pushing forward.

Find ways to occupy yourself, ideally with pursuits that genuinely interest you, things you truly enjoy. If nothing particularly passionate presents itself, then at least choose something that isn’t too disagreeable. One needs that sense of pleasure and busyness to sustain one’s enthusiasm and maintain the vitality of life. Life is short—don’t squander your limited time on things you don’t care for.

Trump, at 77, is still campaigning for president. He has gone bankrupt several times, yet he keeps getting back up and fighting again and again. Though I don’t particularly like the man, I do admire his attitude towards life. By contrast, most Chinese people feel “old” far too early. The moment they encounter a minor setback, they start accepting their fate, give up the fight, and then simply do nothing. Getting out there and doing something—that’s what really matters.

In summary, in one sentence: In life, one must keep moving forward through action—constantly doing something and learning—while cultivating a character of resilience and tenacity.

终身学习。

用自己有限的生命来提高我的生产力，追求发展我个人的智慧和理性。

我喜欢学习，因为这会让自己更聪明。

尽自己最大的努力，成为最好的自己。专注我自己，正如尼采说，不要做苍蝇拍。

到了三十岁，我开始意识到，对个人而言，人生最重要的事就是找到自己想做的事——爱上某些事物，因为只有这样，才能真正感受到生命的存在。人应该尽量避免闲散，一旦闲下来，就很容易陷入虚无主义或抑郁。要不断挑战自我，不断前进。

找到让自己忙碌起来的方法，最好是去做那些你真正感兴趣、真正享受的事情。如果没有什么特别让你充满激情的事情，至少也要选择一些自己不那么厌恶的事情。人需要这种愉悦感和忙碌感来保持热情，维持生命的活力。人生苦短，不要把有限的时间浪费在自己不感兴趣的事情上。

特朗普77岁仍然在竞选总统。他破产多次，却仍然屡败屡战。虽然我不喜欢这个人，但我欣赏他对生活的态度。而大多数中国人，早早的就觉得自己老了。遇到一点挫折，就开始接受自己的命运，从此一蹶不振了，然后就什么都不做。去做点什么，这种很重要。

总结成一句话：人的一生，行动上需要前进，不断做点什么，不断学习。而性格上则需要坚韧和顽强。
