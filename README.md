# Theme of Blog

https://jekyll.github.io/minima


## Features I added

1.Hide a post by `hide: true`.

```yaml
published: true
title: Some title
layout: post

hide: true
```

2. Pin post by `top: true`.  pinned posts remain on top of homepage.

```yaml
published: true
title: Some title
layout: post

top: true
```


## Build

Test blog on local host: 

```
cd myblog

bundle exec jekyll serve
```
